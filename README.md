##### lalboard - A 3D-printed keyboard inspired by the DataHand.

Note: The v2 branch has been deprecated in favor of the [v2_no_stls](https://github.com/JesusFreke/lalboard/tree/v2_no_stls) branch.

The new branch has the exported stls in a separate repository, to help avoid large checkouts when cloning
the base repository.
